# Changelog

## v2.2.0 — 2026-03-23

### New Agent: `bubbles.regression` (Steve French)

Cross-feature regression guardian. Detects test baseline regressions, cross-spec interference, design contradictions, and coverage decreases after implementation or bug fixes.

- **Character:** Steve French (the mountain lion from Trailer Park Boys)
- **Signature:** *"Something's prowlin' around in the code, boys."*
- **Icon:** `steve-french-paw.svg` — a paw print with claw marks (regression scratches)
- **Phase:** `regression` — runs after `test`, before `simplify`
- **Role:** Diagnostic agent (read-only for artifacts, routes fixes to specialists)

### New Gates: G044, G045, G046

- **G044** (`regression_baseline_gate`) — Test baseline snapshot before/after implementation. Previously-passing tests must still pass. Enforced by `regression-baseline-guard.sh`.
- **G045** (`cross_spec_regression_gate`) — Tests from already-done specs re-executed after changes. Catches cross-feature interference (e.g., spec N breaking spec M).
- **G046** (`spec_conflict_detection_gate`) — Route/endpoint collisions, shared table mutations, contradictory business rules scanned across all specs before implementation.

### Post-Implementation Hardening (Mandatory)

All delivery modes now include a mandatory hardening sequence after `test`:

```
implement → test → regression → simplify → stabilize → security → docs → ...
```

**Updated modes:** `full-delivery`, `full-delivery-strict`, `bugfix-fastlane`, `feature-bootstrap`, `value-first-e2e-batch`, `chaos-hardening`, `product-to-delivery`, `harden-to-doc`, `gaps-to-doc`, `harden-gaps-to-doc`, `reconcile-to-doc`, `stabilize-to-doc`, `improve-existing`, `stochastic-quality-sweep`, `iterate`

Previously, `simplify`, `stabilize`, and `security` were only in specialized modes. Now they run on every delivery.

### New Governance Script

- `regression-baseline-guard.sh` — Mechanical enforcement for G044/G045/G046. Checks test baseline existence, cross-spec inventory, and route collision detection.

### New Recipes

- **[Regression Check](docs/recipes/regression-check.md)** — How to verify new changes didn't break existing features
- **[Post-Implementation Hardening](docs/recipes/post-impl-hardening.md)** — The mandatory hardening sequence explained

### Infrastructure

- `bubbles.regression` added to `agent-ownership.yaml` as diagnostic agent
- `regression` trigger added to `stochastic-quality-sweep` trigger pool
- `regression` fix cycle: `bootstrap → implement → test → validate → audit`
- `e2e-regression.md` expanded with cross-spec regression rules (G044-G046)
- Fun mode messages for regression events (Steve French purring, prowling)
- 29 agents, 45 gates, 18 phases total

## v2.1.0 — 2026-03-19

### New Gate: G040 — Zero Deferral Language

Agents were writing deferral language ("deferred to future scope", "out of scope", "will address later") into DoD items and then marking specs as "done". This is now mechanically blocked.

- **Gate G040** (`zero_deferral_language_gate`) — state-transition-guard.sh Check 18 scans scope and report artifacts for deferral language patterns and BLOCKS promotion to "done" if found
- Added to `inheritedRequiredGates` (applies to ALL delivery modes)
- Deferral scan added to Tier 2 validation tables in: `bubbles.implement` (I5), `bubbles.iterate` (IT6), `bubbles.workflow` (W5), `bubbles.audit` (A7), `bubbles.harden` (H10)
- Rule 2 (Scope Cannot Be Done) and Rule 3 (Spec Cannot Be Done) in agent-common.md updated to explicitly block on deferral language
- Zero Deferral Policy expanded with FABRICATED COMPLETION declaration
- critical-requirements.md "No TODO Debt" expanded with deferral pattern list
- scope-workflow.md Status Transition Gate and Spec Completion sections updated
- 40 gates total (up from 39)

## v2.0.0 — 2026-03-17

Major reorganization and new features. Prefix-based file ownership, per-scope git commits, self-healing loops, framework operations agent, and more.

### Breaking Changes

- `agents/_shared/` → `agents/bubbles_shared/` (all internal references updated)
- `scripts/bubbles*.sh` → `bubbles/scripts/*.sh` (scripts consolidated under `bubbles/` folder, `bubbles-` prefix dropped)
- `scripts/bubbles.sh` → `bubbles/scripts/cli.sh` (main CLI moved)
- Generated docs moved from `.github/docs/BUBBLES_*.md` to `.github/bubbles/docs/`
- `autoCommit` changed from boolean to enum: `off|scope|dod`

### New Features

- **`bubbles.super` agent** (26th agent) — first-touch assistant for framework operations, commands, prompts, setup, upgrades, metrics, custom gates, lessons, and diagnostics
- **Self-healing loop protocol (G039)** — bounded, non-stacking fix loops with maxDepth=1, context narrowing, retry budgets
- **Atomic git commits** — `autoCommit: scope|dod` creates structured commits after validated milestones
- **Lessons-learned memory** — `.specify/memory/lessons.md` with auto-compaction at workflow start when >150 lines
- **Git hooks system** — built-in hook catalog + custom hooks, `hooks.json` registry, `bubbles hooks install/add/remove/run/status`
- **Custom gates** — project-defined quality gates via `.github/bubbles-project.yaml`, auto-discovered by state transition guard
- **Doctor command** — `bubbles doctor [--heal]` validates installation health with 11 checks and auto-fix
- **Scope DAG visualization** — `bubbles dag <spec>` outputs Mermaid dependency diagram
- **Metrics dashboard** — optional, off by default. JSONL event logging for gate failures, phase durations, agent invocations
- **Upgrade command** — `bubbles upgrade [version]` with migration, generated doc regeneration, and staleness recommendations
- **Status --explain** — `bubbles.status --explain` for narrative progress summaries
- **Spec examples gallery** — `docs/examples/` with annotated reference specs for REST API endpoints and bug fixes

### Infrastructure

- Prefix-based file ownership model: `bubbles.` prefix = Bubbles-owned (overwritten on upgrade), everything else = project-owned (never touched)
- Install.sh migration logic for pre-v2 → v2 path transitions
- `bubbles-project.yaml` for project-local extensions (custom gates) without modifying workflows.yaml
- `hooks.json` for hook registry management
- Fun mode aliases for new super agent

## v1.0.0 — 2026-03-17

Initial release. Rebranded from the Ralph agent system.

### What's Included

- **25 agents** — bubbles.workflow through bubbles.bug
- **25 prompt shims** — routing files for VS Code Copilot Chat
- **7 shared governance docs** — agent-common, scope-workflow, templates, etc.
- **9 governance scripts** — artifact lint, state transition guard, etc.
- **1 workflow config** — 23 modes, 33 gates, complete phase definitions
- **23 SVG icons** — one per agent character
- **install.sh** — one-line installer for any repo
- **Documentation** — agent manual, workflow guide, 10 recipes, visual cheatsheet
