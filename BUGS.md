# Bubbles Framework — Known Bugs

> **Why this file exists:** the Bubbles source repo cannot keep `specs/` (G085 dogfood guard), so framework-internal defects are tracked here as the operator-visible bug log. Downstream consumer repos file their bugs in their own `specs/<feature>/bugs/BUG-NNN-*/` structure as usual.

## BUG-001 — state-transition-guard.sh hangs in Check 3G (Framework Ownership And Result Contract)

- **Filed:** 2026-05-27
- **Disposition:** partially-mitigated (this file) — fail-safe timeout shipped; root-cause items still open
- **Discovered by:** `bubbles.goal` session implementing G022/G060/G061 fixes
- **Severity:** low (was medium) — the guard now fails cleanly instead of hanging; selftest converges
- **Affects:** `bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh` Check 3G (Framework Ownership And Result Contract — gates G042/G063/G064)

### Mitigation Shipped (partial)

Check 3G now wraps its sub-guard invocation in a hard timeout and reports its
wall-clock cost, so the indefinite hang is gone — the check fails safe with a
named error instead of blocking forever:

- `state-transition-guard.sh` ~L765: `bubbles_run_with_timeout 30 bash "$framework_ownership_lint_script"` — on overrun it emits `Framework ownership lint TIMED OUT after 30s (BUG-001 guard)` and counts a failure (item 1 — done for Check 3G).
- `state-transition-guard.sh` ~L779: `warn "Check 3G wall-clock ${_c3g_elapsed}s exceeded the 30s budget"` (item 3 — per-check budget surfaced for Check 3G).
- The same `bubbles_run_with_timeout` wrapper now guards the other heavy sub-invocations (artifact-lint ~L2158, freshness-guard ~L2176, reality-scan ~L2352).

Still open: the root-cause filesystem-walk exclusions in the sub-guards (item 2)
and a hermetic perf regression with a synthetic large-spec fixture (item 4).

### Reproduction

```bash
cd /path/to/any/downstream/repo/with/real/spec
timeout 15 bash <bubbles>/bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh specs/<NNN-feature>
# Observed: process times out (exit 124); last printed line is "--- Check 3G: Framework Ownership And Result Contract (G042/G063/G064) ---"
# Hang occurs AFTER Check 3F completes successfully.
```

Concrete observation during the G022/G060/G061 fix session:

```
✅ PASS: state.json transitionRequests queue is empty
✅ PASS: state.json reworkQueue is empty
✅ PASS: Transition and rework routing is closed

--- Check 3G: Framework Ownership And Result Contract (G042/G063/G064) ---
<hangs indefinitely until SIGTERM>
```

### Suspected Root Cause

Check 3G appears to invoke a sub-guard (likely `agent-ownership-lint.sh` or a packet-routing scanner) without a timeout, OR performs a recursive filesystem walk that touches large generated directories (`.git/`, `node_modules/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, container build caches) without exclusions. Needs root-cause investigation.

### Impact

- `state-transition-guard.sh` cannot complete on real downstream spec dirs in reasonable time (observed >60s, killed at 300s during selftest).
- `state-transition-guard-selftest.sh` runs all 1230 lines through the guard repeatedly and exceeds wall-clock budget on developer machines.
- Forces operators to invoke individual sub-guards instead of the unified entry point.

### Required Fix

1. ~~Add a 30s hard timeout around every sub-guard invocation in Check 3G (and audit Checks 3-34 for the same pattern).~~ **DONE for Check 3G + the heavy sub-invocations** (see Mitigation Shipped above); a full Checks 3–34 audit is still advisable.
2. Add exclusion globs (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `vendor`, `dist`, `__pycache__`, `.bubbles-cache`, container build dirs) to any filesystem walks in Check 3G's sub-guards. **OPEN** (root cause).
3. ~~Add a per-check wall-clock budget reported in the verdict so future regressions surface immediately.~~ **DONE for Check 3G** (budget warn at ~L779); broaden to all checks if the pattern recurs.
4. Add a hermetic perf regression to `tests/regression/` that runs Check 3G against a synthetic 500-spec fixture and fails if elapsed > 5s. **OPEN.**

### Acceptance

- `timeout 60 bash bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh specs/<real-feature>` returns exit code (any) within 60s on every downstream repo.
- `state-transition-guard-selftest.sh` completes within 5 minutes.
- Per-check wall-clock budget appears in verdict block.

### Cross-References

- Discovered while implementing G022/G060/G061 (commit `1d79931`).
- This bug is the canonical demonstration of Gate G095 (Discovered-Issue Disposition) — it was previously deflected with "pre-existing and unrelated" and is now filed properly.
