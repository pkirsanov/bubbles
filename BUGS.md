# Bubbles Framework — Known Bugs

> **Why this file exists:** the Bubbles source repo cannot keep `specs/` (G085 dogfood guard), so framework-internal defects are tracked here as the operator-visible bug log. Downstream consumer repos file their bugs in their own `specs/<feature>/bugs/BUG-NNN-*/` structure as usual.

## BUG-001 — state-transition-guard.sh hangs in Check 3G (Framework Ownership And Result Contract)

- **Filed:** 2026-05-27
- **Disposition:** bug-filed (this file)
- **Discovered by:** `bubbles.goal` session implementing G022/G060/G061 fixes
- **Severity:** medium (does not block correctness, blocks selftest convergence)
- **Affects:** `bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh` Check 3G (Framework Ownership And Result Contract — gates G042/G063/G064)

### Reproduction

```bash
cd /path/to/any/downstream/repo/with/real/spec
timeout 15 bash <bubbles>/bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh specs/<NNN-feature>
# Observed: process times out (exit 124); last printed line is "--- Check 3G: Framework Ownership And Result Contract (G042/G063/G064) ---"
# Hang occurs AFTER Check 3F completes successfully.
```

Concrete observation during the G022/G060/G061 fix session:

```
✅ PASS: state.json transitionRequests queue is empty
✅ PASS: state.json reworkQueue is empty
✅ PASS: Transition and rework routing is closed

--- Check 3G: Framework Ownership And Result Contract (G042/G063/G064) ---
<hangs indefinitely until SIGTERM>
```

### Suspected Root Cause

Check 3G appears to invoke a sub-guard (likely `agent-ownership-lint.sh` or a packet-routing scanner) without a timeout, OR performs a recursive filesystem walk that touches large generated directories (`.git/`, `node_modules/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, container build caches) without exclusions. Needs root-cause investigation.

### Impact

- `state-transition-guard.sh` cannot complete on real downstream spec dirs in reasonable time (observed >60s, killed at 300s during selftest).
- `state-transition-guard-selftest.sh` runs all 1230 lines through the guard repeatedly and exceeds wall-clock budget on developer machines.
- Forces operators to invoke individual sub-guards instead of the unified entry point.

### Required Fix

1. Add a 30s hard timeout around every sub-guard invocation in Check 3G (and audit Checks 3-34 for the same pattern).
2. Add exclusion globs (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `vendor`, `dist`, `__pycache__`, `.bubbles-cache`, container build dirs) to any filesystem walks in Check 3G's sub-guards.
3. Add a per-check wall-clock budget reported in the verdict so future regressions surface immediately.
4. Add a hermetic perf regression to `tests/regression/` that runs Check 3G against a synthetic 500-spec fixture and fails if elapsed > 5s.

### Acceptance

- `timeout 60 bash bubbles/scripts/state-transition-guard.sh specs/<real-feature>` returns exit code (any) within 60s on every downstream repo.
- `state-transition-guard-selftest.sh` completes within 5 minutes.
- Per-check wall-clock budget appears in verdict block.

### Cross-References

- Discovered while implementing G022/G060/G061 (commit `1d79931`).
- This bug is the canonical demonstration of Gate G095 (Discovered-Issue Disposition) — it was previously deflected with "pre-existing and unrelated" and is now filed properly.
