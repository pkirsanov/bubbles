## BUG-003 — runSubagent dispatch fails with Anthropic 400 — thinking blocks in the latest assistant message are mutated during sub-agent payload construction (extended-thinking + tool-use)

- **Filed:** 2026-06-11
- **Disposition:** external/upstream — NOT a Bubbles framework defect and not fixable in this repo; workaround documented; upstream fix recommended to `microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat` (filing pending a one-time SAML PAT authorization). Per Gate G095 this entry is a tracked EXTERNAL dependency, not an open framework defect.
- **Discovered by:** operator report during a `bubbles.goal` orchestrator session (4 consecutive dispatch failures in one turn)
- **Severity:** high for orchestrator/delegation modes (`bubbles.goal`, `bubbles.workflow`, `bubbles.sprint`) — these perform all implementation via `runSubagent`, so a failed dispatch halts progress for the rest of that turn. No impact on non-orchestrator agents.
- **Affects:** the VS Code Copilot Chat agent runtime's `runSubagent` dispatch payload serializer (`microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat`). NOT any file in this repo. The Bubbles agent definitions are correct.

> **Artifact convention:** the Bubbles source repo cannot keep `specs/` (Gate
> G085 dogfood guard), so this single entry is the full bug artifact. Because
> the defect is UPSTREAM (in the VS Code Copilot Chat agent runtime, not in this
> repo), the entry documents reproduction + root cause + recommended upstream fix
> + confirmed workaround IN LIEU OF an in-repo fix. No code changed in this repo
> for this bug, and none can — there is nothing here to fix.

### Reproduction

Extended-thinking model with interleaved thinking enabled; a long parent turn
with many tool calls and accumulated thinking blocks, including at least one
large (greater than ~8 KB) tool result that triggers the runtime's "large tool
result written to file" content-substitution rewrite; then a `runSubagent`
call. The dispatch fails with an Anthropic `400 invalid_request_error` at
`messages.N.content.M` where that block is a `thinking` / `redacted_thinking`
block (observed locus: `messages.1.content.4` — message index 1, content block
index 4).

### Root Cause (hypothesis)

The sub-agent dispatch harness rebuilds the outbound message array and mutates a
prior assistant message's `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks
(re-serialization, whitespace/key-order normalization, content-block
re-ordering, signature drop, or splicing injected content such as the
large-result-to-file pointer or reminder text) instead of forwarding them
verbatim. Anthropic requires `thinking` blocks on extended-thinking + tool-use
round-trips to be returned byte-for-byte unchanged INCLUDING the signature and
in their original position relative to the `tool_use` block; any change yields a
400.

Tell-tale: a clean stateless sub-agent payload is `[system, user(dispatch
prompt)]` — content index 4 of message 1 (a user message) is never a thinking
block, so a thinking block there is direct evidence the harness is replaying a
parent assistant turn into the sub-agent request and then mutating it.

### Recommended Upstream Fix

Priority order:

1. **Start sub-agents with a clean message history** — build the payload from
   system prompt + dispatch prompt only; do not replay parent thinking-bearing
   assistant turns. If parent context is needed, forward a plain-text summary as
   user content, never replayed assistant thinking blocks. (Primary fix;
   directly explains the `messages.1.content.4` tell.)
2. **(Reframed) Preserve `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks verbatim** —
   applies to the PARENT turn-continuation after the sub-agent returns (text +
   signature, original position). For sub-agent dispatch itself, fix 1
   supersedes (do not forward them at all).
3. **Decouple harness content-substitution from thinking blocks** — the
   large-tool-result-to-file rewrite and reminder injection must touch user-role
   messages ONLY (`tool_result` blocks live in user-role messages and carry no
   signature). Pass assistant messages through verbatim; if an assistant message
   must be edited, strip its thinking blocks entirely and consistently, never
   partially. (Primary fix for the parent-continuation manifestation.)
4. **Fail soft** — detect the modified-thinking-block condition pre-flight (or
   on the 400) and retry once with a thinking-stripped history instead of
   surfacing a raw 400; self-verify by diffing outbound thinking bytes against
   what the model originally returned. (Safety net.)

### Confirmed Workaround

A fresh user turn clears it — the mutated in-turn assistant message is no longer
the latest, so the next turn's dispatch succeeds; no data lost. Operationally
for orchestrator modes: dispatch sub-agents earlier in a turn (before
accumulating many large tool results + thinking blocks) to reduce trigger
probability.

### Triage Note

An earlier note linked the failure to a source file in a downstream product
(an internal agent file that was merely open in the editor at failure time).
That was a RED HERRING — that file uses a plain `Role`+`Content` string message
model over a Python sidecar and cannot emit Anthropic content-block errors.
Route the upstream issue to the sub-agent request serialization path in
`microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat`, NOT to any downstream product or the framework.
