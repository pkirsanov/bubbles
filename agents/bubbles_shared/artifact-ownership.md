# Artifact Ownership

Artifact authorship is a hard boundary, not a suggestion. Violations are blocking — the ownership lint (`agent-ownership-lint.sh`) and state-transition guard enforce these rules mechanically.

## Canonical Ownership

| Artifact | Owner | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `spec.md` business requirements, actors, use cases, scenarios | `bubbles.analyst` | `bubbles.ux` may update only UX sections of `spec.md` |
| `design.md` | `bubbles.design` | Technical design only |
| `scopes.md` / `scopes/*/scope.md` planning content | `bubbles.plan` | Gherkin, Test Plan, DoD, execution structure |
| `report.md` template structure | `bubbles.plan` | Execution evidence is appended by execution agents |
| `report.md` evidence content | `bubbles.implement`, `bubbles.test`, `bubbles.validate`, `bubbles.audit`, `bubbles.chaos`, `bubbles.harden`, `bubbles.gaps`, `bubbles.stabilize`, `bubbles.security`, `bubbles.regression` | Append-only to their own sections |
| `uservalidation.md` | `bubbles.plan` | Acceptance checklist/template |
| `bug.md` | `bubbles.bug` | Bug description, reproduction, severity |
| `state.json` certification state | `bubbles.validate` | `certification.*`, promotion state, and reopen/invalidate certification only |
| `state.json` execution claims | All execution agents | `execution.*` fields only — never `certification.*` |
| `scenario-manifest.json` | `bubbles.plan` | `bubbles.test`, `bubbles.validate`, `bubbles.regression` may update evidence links only |
| Product code / tests | `bubbles.implement`, `bubbles.test` | Per their phase ownership |
| Standard docs (`docs/`) | `bubbles.docs` | Must reflect real implementation state |

## Read-Only Diagnostic And Certification Agents

`bubbles.validate`, `bubbles.audit`, `bubbles.harden`, `bubbles.gaps`, `bubbles.stabilize`, `bubbles.security`, `bubbles.code-review`, `bubbles.system-review`, `bubbles.regression`, and `bubbles.clarify` are diagnostic or certification agents. They MAY identify missing scenarios, tests, contracts, or DoD items, but they MUST NOT directly author foreign-owned planning, execution, or certification surfaces.

## Foreign-Artifact Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

If an agent discovers that a foreign-owned artifact must change:

1. It MUST NOT edit that artifact itself — not even "small fixes" or "obvious corrections".
2. It MUST emit a concrete `route_required` result envelope or invoke the owning agent via `runSubagent`, never a narrative-only handoff or "suggested next step".
3. If invoked by `bubbles.workflow`, `bubbles.iterate`, or another orchestrator, it MUST return the route-required packet so the orchestrator can invoke the owner immediately.
4. If invoked standalone, it may explicitly delegate to the owner via `runSubagent`, or it must stop with a concrete owner-targeted route result; it still MUST NOT perform foreign-owned remediation inline.
5. The phase MUST NOT be reported complete until the owning specialist has run and the result has been verified.

**Examples of violations:**
- `bubbles.harden` adding new Gherkin scenarios to `scopes.md` → must invoke `bubbles.plan`
- `bubbles.implement` creating `uservalidation.md` → must invoke `bubbles.plan`
- `bubbles.gaps` updating DoD items in `scopes.md` → must invoke `bubbles.plan`
- `bubbles.test` modifying `spec.md` requirements → must invoke `bubbles.analyst`
- `bubbles.docs` changing `design.md` architecture → must invoke `bubbles.design`
- Any agent writing `certification.*` fields in `state.json` → must route to `bubbles.validate`

## Execution-Only Exception

`bubbles.implement` may update `scopes.md` only for execution-progress concerns already defined by planning artifacts: inline evidence, DoD checkbox completion, and scope progress tied to completed work. It MUST NOT invent new Gherkin scenarios, Test Plan rows, or DoD structures that belong to `bubbles.plan`.

## Enforcement

The ownership contract is enforced at three levels:

1. **Prompt-level** — each agent declares an explicit `**Artifact Ownership**` block listing what it owns and what is foreign. This declaration is cross-checked against `agent-ownership.yaml`.
2. **Lint-level** — `agent-ownership-lint.sh` verifies that diagnostic agents do not contain language permitting foreign-artifact edits, and that every agent's declared ownership matches the YAML registry.
3. **Guard-level** — `state-transition-guard.sh` verifies artifact authorship coherence before allowing `done` transitions (Gate G062).
